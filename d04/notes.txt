--->/posts/--->#index---> view   <---MVC

in models, inside concerns, we have a post.rb file
in controllers, inside concerns, we have post_controller.rb
  - this has the active record and the PostController class
  - have to define posts in the post_controllers.rb
  - inside the PostsController class we have a method, inside reads: @posts = Post.all
  - has to be an instance variable so that it can be passed into the index.html.erb
in views,  we have index.html.erb,
 - use embedded ruby. must use the @posts instance variable from post_controller.erb

show, new, index and edit are the html.erb files we will need
  - new, create, show, destroy and edit
  - new/html.erb used for new and create methods
  - show.html.erb used for show method

stylesheets go in assets. name the css file by the name of the app.
  - easier for linking
