if @article.save
  redirect_to article_path(@article)
else
  render new
end

only use on create and update methods since thats the only places where thigns are saved.

render vs redirect
- render wont trigger controller action
- redirect actually calls action and creates news thing while deleting the old.
- render updates the old thing and adds the new thing as well.
- unless you call to delete the old thing, with render, the old thing will remain


.create method wil add to db, but .new will save it
cannot do this with .create because you need to add data to the thing before you save it
